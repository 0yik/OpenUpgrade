Individual users are no longer supported on ir_rules.
Maintenance contract / OPW are ignored for a lack of meaningful test data.
You may see: tests failed to execute in module base. This concerns test data.
You may see: "unable to set column model_id of table ir_rule not null". This is handled in a later stage.
Todo: convert model 'ir.report.custom.fields' to 'base_report_creator.report.fields'
