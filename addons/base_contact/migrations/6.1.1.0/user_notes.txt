Overview:
- res.partner.address is changed to res.partner.location + contact
- res.partner.jobs is dropped in favor of using res.partner.address
- res.partner.contact itself stayed about the same (explicit last_name added)

The following fields from res.partner.jobs no longer have equivalent:
- 'sequence_contact': fields.integer('Contact Seq.',help='Order of importance of this address in the list of addresses of the linked contact'),
- 'sequence_partner': fields.integer('Partner Seq.',help='Order of importance of this job title in the list of job title of the linked partner'),
- 'extension': fields.char('Extension', size=64, help='Internal/External extension phone number'),
- 'other': fields.char('Other', size=64, help='Additional phone field'),
- 'date_start': fields.date('Date Start',help="Start date of job(Joining Date)"),
- 'date_stop': fields.date('Date Stop', help="Last date of job"),
- 'state': fields.selection([('past', 'Past'),('current', 'Current')], 'State', required=True, help="Status of Address"),

You may want to review your data if you use above fields.

res.partner.job table is not dropped.

Original res.partner.job.id is stored in column x_openupgrade_job_id of
res.partner.address object, which can be reused later on to migrate above fields
into notes field or res.partner.address for example.
