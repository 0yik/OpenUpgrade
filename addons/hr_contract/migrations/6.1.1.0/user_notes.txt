Gross and net advantages have been dropped and incorporated into the more
general framework of hr_payroll.

The values of those fields have been evacuated to
openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_net
openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_gross

If you want to add them to the notes field, run following query:
---
update hr_contract set notes=
coalesce(notes||E'\n', '') || 'gross advantages: ' || 
coalesce(cast(openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_gross as varchar), '') 
|| E'\nnet advantages: ' || 
coalesce(cast(openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_net as varchar), '');
---
