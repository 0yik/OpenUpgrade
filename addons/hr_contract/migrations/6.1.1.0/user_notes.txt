hr.contract.wage.type and hr.contract.wage.type.period have been dropped and
incorporated into hr_payroll.

These tables still exist in the database.

In case you don't want to step over to hr_payroll, you might want to consider
hr_contract_legacy.

Also gross and net advantages have been dropped and incorporated into hr_payroll.

The values of those fields have been evacuated to
openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_net
openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_gross

If you want to add them to the notes field, run following query:
---
update hr_contract set notes=
coalesce(notes||E'\n', '') || 'gross advantages: ' || 
coalesce(cast(openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_gross as varchar), '') 
|| E'\nnet advantages: ' || 
coalesce(cast(openupgrade_legacy_6_1_0_final_0_advantages_net as varchar), '');
---
