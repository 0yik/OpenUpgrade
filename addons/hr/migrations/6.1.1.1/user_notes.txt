Marital status has been changed (back) to be a selection. The script tries to find a suitable selection entry from the list of marital states. This will fail if you customized this list, you'll get a warning about the employee IDs with marital states not in the selection, and find the original values in column openupgrade_6_1_1_1_legacy_marital. If you customize the selection *before* the migration with the same values used in the list of martial states, this script will pick up those values too.
If there are no unknown marital states (either because you didn't customize them or you put your customizations into the selection), the legacy column and the table will be dropped after migration.
