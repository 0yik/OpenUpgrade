This upgrade adds an indication of uom ratio's (bigger, reference or smaller). The default value is 'reference'. You might want to review this setting on your UOMs.
A number of standard product categories and UOM categories are added as well. Group Product Manager is now obsolete. Product management is delegated to Sale and Purchase managers. Membership is not transferred automatically. You may want to review the membership of these two groups.
Modified access permissions and security rules are reloaded.
